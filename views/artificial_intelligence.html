        <h2>Artificial Intelligence can be divided into a few catagories</h2><br />
        AI is composed of all the following Research, Machines, and Stacks. With all these diverse layers branches of we have the encompassing topic of AI.

                <td>Artificial Intelligence strides have been greatly increased with the democratization of technology in recent years. Technology / Cloud vendors have recently offered many cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology stacks to the masses e.g. Data Collection, Data Storage, Data Processing / Computing, Data Analytics, and Data Output / Reporting. </td>

        <h2>Sub-Fields of Artificial Intelligence</h2>          
        Artificial Intelligence has sub-fields that are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "machine learning", natural language, speech, "robotics" and vision).
